// Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

function charCount(str: string) {
  // do something
  // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; 
  // values should be the counts for those characters
}

function charCountV2(str: string) {
  // make object to return at end ...
  // loop over string, for each character...
  // 1. If the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
  // 2. If the char is a number/letter AND not in object, add it to object and set count to 1
  // 3. If the char is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything

  // return object at end
