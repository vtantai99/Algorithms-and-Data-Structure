# **Problem solving**

1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Example
3. Break It Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor

### Frequency counter pattern
1. _This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values_
2. _This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings_
### Multiple pointers pattern
1. _Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition_
2. _Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well_
